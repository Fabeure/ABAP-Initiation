    ##### Step 1: Creating the custom screen 

    Let's start off by creating our new screen that will hold the ALV report. It can be created in a similar way we created our Include files: through the repository browser.

    ![Screen_Create](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Screen_Create.png?raw=true)

    Give your screen a unique number. This number will be used to access the screen in your source code.

    ![Screen_Number](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Screen_Number.png?raw=true)

    Now that our screen has been created, we need to code it's **flow logic**.

    The flow logic of the screen is simply how the screen will operate. We can visualize it using this flow chart

    ``` mermaid
      graph TD;
            A[Call Screen 001]-->B[PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT];
            B[PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT]-->C[WAIT FOR USER INTERACTION];
            C[WAIT FOR USER INTERACTION]-->D[PROCESS AFTER INPUT];
            D -->E[EXIT SCREEN];
            D -- Program returns to PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT every time -->B;
            
    ```

    In summary, when you first call your screen, the PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT code will be executed.
    Then, the screen will wait for user input. 
    After the user input comes in, the PROCESS AFTER INPUT code will be executed and then the screen loops back to the PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT code. 
    This will keep happening until the user decides to exit the screen.

    Back to our source code, lets un-comment our PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT and PROCESS AFTER INPUT modules.

    ![Uncomment](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Uncomment.png?raw=true)

    Double on each module and create it (you will be prompted to create a new object for each module).

    Your project structure should look something like this now: 

    ![Modules](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Modules.png?raw=true)

    Let's first take a look at our STATUS module (This is the module that will be executed every time you do an action once the screen is called)

    ![status](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/status.png?raw=true)  

    Let's uncomment the status and and title bar and create both object by **double clicking on their names**

    Your project structure should look like this now

    ![Status_Uncommented](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Status_Uncommented.png?raw=true)


    The title bar is the title that will be show on top of your screen after you call it, and it doesnt affect the contents of the screen.

    The GUI status represents the buttons and shortcuts the user will be able to see and use after calling the screen. 


    Let's setup a few usefull keys so the user can navigate in and out of the screen.

    First add the keys in the Function Keys tab of the GUI STATUS 

    ![Keys](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Keys.png?raw=true)

    Now let's move over to the **USER COMMANDS** module. This is where we will code the logic of our keys


    ```abap
      *----------------------------------------------------------------------*
      ***INCLUDE ZMM_DOCUMENTATION_SABER_USEI01.
      *----------------------------------------------------------------------*
      *&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
      *&      Module  USER_COMMAND_0001  INPUT
      *&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
      *       text
      *----------------------------------------------------------------------*
      MODULE USER_COMMAND_0001 INPUT.
      CASE sy-ucomm. "the SY-UCOMM variable allows us to access which user command has been sent to the system
      WHEN 'BACK'.
      LEAVE TO SCREEN 0.
      WHEN 'LEAVE'.
      LEAVE PROGRAM.
      WHEN 'EXIT'.
      LEAVE PROGRAM.
      ENDCASE.
      ENDMODULE.
    ```	



    We can now call our screen from our main and take a look at it

    ``` abap
         DATA : s_idsal TYPE ZEXOSALARIES-ID_SAL,
            s_nomsal TYPE ZEXOSALARIES-NOM_SALARIES,
            s_prenomsal TYPE ZEXOSALARIES-PRENOM_SALARIES,
            s_datnaissancesal TYPE ZEXOSALARIES-DATE_DE_NAISSANCE,
            it_salaries TYPE TABLE OF ZEXOSALARIES,
            wa_salaries TYPE ZEXOSALARIES.

      DATA : it_societe TYPE TABLE OF T001,
            wa_societe TYPE T001.

      SELECT-OPTIONS :
                  s_id for s_idsal,
                  s_nom for s_nomsal NO INTERVALS,
                  s_prenom for s_prenomsal NO INTERVALS,
                  s_dat for s_datnaissancesal.


      PERFORM SELECT_SALARIES.
      PERFORM SORT_SALARIES.
      PERFORM SELECT_SOCIETES.
      PERFORM WRITE_SALARIES.

      CALL SCREEN 001.

      INCLUDE ZIMM_DOCUMENTATION_F01.
      INCLUDE zmm_documentation_saber_stao01.
      INCLUDE zmm_documentation_saber_usei01.
    ```

    We now have an empty screen. 

    ![Screen_Empty](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Screen_Empty.png?raw=true)



    ##### Step 2: Designing a custom container

    Now that we have our empty screen ready to be used, lets design a custom container that will "hold" the data that we will display.

    we can do this by clicking on the layout editor in our screen source file.

    ![Layout](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Layout.png?raw=true)


    You should now be in the layout editor that looks like this

    ![Editor](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Editor.png?raw=true)

    Lets drag and drop a new custom container on our screen and give it a name

    ![Container](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Container.png?raw=true)

    Make sure you fit it correctly to the size of your screen.


    ##### Step 3: linking our custom screen and container to our source code

    Now that we have created our screen, and designed the container that will hold our data, its time link both to our source code. 

    Let's declare a few class instances that we will need 
    ```abap
      DATA : GV_CONTAINER001 TYPE REF TO CL_GUI_CUSTOM_CONTAINER,
             GV_GRID001      TYPE REF TO CL_GUI_ALV_GRID.
    ```  
    Let's now link our container and grid using the classes **cl_gui_custom_container** and **cl_gui_alv_grid**

    We can do this in the PBO module to keep our code organized

    ```abap
      *----------------------------------------------------------------------*
      ***INCLUDE ZMM_DOCUMENTATION_SABER_STAO01.
      *----------------------------------------------------------------------*
      *&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
      *& Module STATUS_0001 OUTPUT
      *&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
      *&
      *&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
      MODULE STATUS_0001 OUTPUT.
      SET PF-STATUS 'STATUS001'.
      SET TITLEBAR 'SCREEN001'.

      IF GV_CONTAINER001 IS INITIAL. " we add this condition to only create the container and grid once.
       CREATE OBJECT GV_CONTAINER001
       EXPORTING
       CONTAINER_NAME = 'CONTAINER001'.

       CREATE OBJECT GV_GRID001
       EXPORTING
       I_PARENT = GV_CONTAINER001.
       ENDIF.

      ENDMODULE.
    ```  

    ##### Step 4: Preparing our data for display

    Let's now make a form that will handle preparing and displaying our data 

    ```abap
      *&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
      *& Form display_data
      *&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
      *& populate internal tables from ZEXOSALARIES and T001
      *& display alv usign LVC_FIELDCATALOG_MERGE and GRID0100->SET_TABLE_FOR_FIRST_DISPLAY
      *& CTRL+F6 to get function template
      *&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
      *& -->  p1        text
      *& <--  p2        text
      *&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
      FORM DISPLAY_DATA .
            DATA : GT_FCAT1   TYPE LVC_T_FCAT,  "table to hold fields
                  GS_FCAT1   LIKE LINE OF GT_FCAT1,
                  GS_LAYOUT1 TYPE LVC_S_LAYO. "layout of our report


            " initial internal table data population from database tables
            PERFORM SELECT_SALARIES.

            PERFORM SORT_SALARIES.

            PERFORM SELECT_SOCIETES.



            " fetch all fields from final internal table and merge them in GT_FCAT1 table
            CALL FUNCTION 'LVC_FIELDCATALOG_MERGE'
            EXPORTING
            *     I_BUFFER_ACTIVE        =
                  I_STRUCTURE_NAME       = 'ZEXOSALARIES'
            *     I_CLIENT_NEVER_DISPLAY = 'X'
            *     I_BYPASSING_BUFFER     =
                  I_INTERNAL_TABNAME     = 'it_salaries'
            CHANGING
                  CT_FIELDCAT            = GT_FCAT1
            EXCEPTIONS
                  INCONSISTENT_INTERFACE = 1
                  PROGRAM_ERROR          = 2
                  OTHERS                 = 3.
            IF SY-SUBRC <> 0.
            * Implement suitable error handling here
            ENDIF.


            " display alv report
            CALL METHOD GV_GRID001->SET_TABLE_FOR_FIRST_DISPLAY
            EXPORTING
            *     I_BUFFER_ACTIVE               =
            *     I_BYPASSING_BUFFER            =

            *     IR_SALV_ADAPTER               =
            CHANGING
                  IT_OUTTAB                     = it_salaries
                  IT_FIELDCATALOG               = GT_FCAT1
            *     IT_SORT                       =

            EXCEPTIONS
                  INVALID_PARAMETER_COMBINATION = 1

                  TOO_MANY_LINES                = 3
                  OTHERS                        = 4.
            IF SY-SUBRC <> 0.
            *     Implement suitable error handling here
            ENDIF.


      ENDFORM.	
    ```
    **Explanation** : We first start off by declaring a field catalog variable
    This variable is a table that will contain the fields that we will display on our screen.

    We use the function **LVC_FIELDCATALOG_MERGE** to automatically set all fields in the GT_FCAT1 table.

    Then we use the SET_TABLE_FOR_FIRST_DISPLAY method of our grid instance to display our screen.

    Running our program gives us this display now (Don't forget to call the DISPLAY_DATA form in the PBO module)
