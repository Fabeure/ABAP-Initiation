### Exercise 11 - Extended Program Control

- Context 

    For code quality assurance, SAP has its own utilities like the "Extended Program Check." This feature will analyze your program and list all development errors that can lead to system errors or execute unintended processes.

- Problem

    Run the Extended Program Check utility using CTRL+F4, and make sure your program doesnt contain any warnings or errors. 

- Solution

    Let's start by executing the **Extended Program Check** utility

    ![EPC](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/EPC.png)

    Let's enable all the program checks 

    ![Enable](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Enable.png)

    running the checker gives us the following result

    ![Erros](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Erros.png)
    ![Errors2](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Errors2.png)

    Clicking on an error or warning will give more details about them

    ![Errors1](https://github.com/Fabeure/ABAP-Initiation/blob/main/Images/Errors1.png)

    Your job is to now fix these errors one by one until you achive an extended program check that gives 0 warnings, 0 errors, and 0 messages.
