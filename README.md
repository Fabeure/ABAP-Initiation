## Introduction

This project will serve as an initiation to programming in ABAP and is aimed toward absolute beginners. \
\
The project will be split into several small tasks, each of which will get progressively less guided.

Hints, explanations and full code solutions with respective outputs will be provided for every exercice.

You will learn the basics of data manipulation, visualization, conversion, and many more functionalities throughout this exercice.

## Pre-requesites

You'll first need access to an SAP system via the ABAP GUI, which will be provided to you.

This guide will only assume you have an understanding of basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, basic SQL, and object oriented programming (OO).
